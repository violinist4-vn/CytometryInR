![](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/offices-of-the-dean/information-services/screenshots/mappedrives02.png){width=50%}

[**Week 2: February 9, 2026**]{.underline} For this session, we focus on how to programmatically tell your computer where to locate your experimental files, introducing the concept of [file paths](https://ytakemon.github.io/2019-10-22-R-BCCRC/02-filedir/). We explore how the various operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows) specify their respective folders and files, and how to identify where you are currently within the directory. Our goal by the end of this session is to have walked you through how to figure out where an .fcs file of interest is stored, and convey to your computer where you want it copied/moved to, without encountering the common pitfalls. 

<br>
<br>

### Inside an .FCS file

[**Week 3: February 16, 2026**]{.underline} In the course of this session we will slice into an .FCS file and find out what the individual components that make it up are. In the process, we will cover the concepts of main [data structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html) within R (vectors, matrices, data.frames, list) and how to identify what we are working with. Additionally, we will explore how various cytometry softwares store their metadata variables under various keywords that can be useful to know about. 

<br>
<br>

### Introduction to the Tidyverse

![](images/histograms.png){width=75%}

[**Week 4: February 23, 2026**]{.underline} Within this session, we explore how the various [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/) packages can be utilized to reorganize rows and columns of data in ways that are useful for data analysis. We will primarily work with the MFI expression data we isolated from within the .fcs file in the previous session, identifying and isolating events that meet certain criterias. We introduce the concepts behind ["tidy"](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) data and how it can improve our workflows. 

<br>
<br>

We close out providing links to [additional helpful resources](https://youtu.be/_indbXPXUw8?si=iZRFHzWvBZg-wu_X) and highlight the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. 

<br>
<br>

### Applying Transformations and Compensation

![](images/subsetting.png){width=75%}

[**Week 7:**]{.underline} For this seventh session, we take a closer look at the raw values of the data within our .fcs files, and explore the various ways to [transform](https://docs.flowjo.com/flowjo/graphs-and-gating/gw-transform-overview/) (ie. scale) flow cytometry data in R to better visualize "positive" and "negative populations". In the process, we visualize the differences resulting from applying different transformations commonly used by commercial software. Similarly, we learn how to apply and visualize compensation in context of conventional flow cytometry files. 

<br>
<br>

### Manual and Automated Gating

![](images/openCyto.png){width=75%}

[**Week 10:**]{.underline} Within this session, we will expand on our growing understanding of GatingSets, functions and fcs file internals to write a script to downsample your fcs files to a desired number (or percentage) of cells for a given cell population. We will additionally learn how to concatenate these downsampled files together, and save them to a new .fcs file in ways that the metadata can be read by commercial software without the scaling being widely thrown off.  

<br>
<br>

### Retrieving data for Statistics

![](images/TidyData.png){width=33%}

[**Week 11:**]{.underline} Leveraging the increased familiarity working with the various packages this far in the course, in this session we will retrieve summary statistics for the gates within our GatingSet, and programmatically derrive out tidy data.frames for use in statistical analyses typically used by many Immunologist. In the process, we add a couple additional plot types to our ggplot2 arsenal to hold in reserve should Prism prices go up again. 

<br>
<br>

### Spectral Signatures

We also introduce [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) package and it's interactive plotting features, before showcasing various packages attempts at facilitating signature retrieval. 
 
<br>
<br>

### Similarities and Hotspots

![](images/Hotspot.png){width=75%}

[**Week 13:**]{.underline} During this session, we will utilize the spectral signature matrix isolated from raw spectral flow cytometry controls and evaluate different ways of evaluating how similar different fluorescent signatures are to each other.  In the process, we will gain better understanding of the metrics behind similarity (cosine), panel complexity (kappa), and unmixing-dependent spreading (collinearity). 

<br>
<br>

### Unmixing in R

![](images/Unmixing.png){width=75%}

[**Week 14:**]{.underline} In the course of this session, we will attempt a reach goal of many, namely carry out unmixing of raw .fcs files using the spectral signatures we have isolated from our unmixing controls, and write to new .fcs files. After evaluating the necessary internals, we will explore how various current cytometry R packages have implemented their own unmixing functions, and the various limitations that each approach has encountered.  

<br>
<br>

### Cleaning Algorithms

![](images/DegradingAPCFire810Signatures.png){width=75%}

[**Week 15:**]{.underline} In the span of this session, we will directly compare how various Bioconductor data cleanup algorithms (namely [PeacoQC](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/PeacoQC/inst/doc/PeacoQC_Vignette.pdf), [FlowAI](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/flowAI/inst/doc/flowAI.html), [FlowCut](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/flowCut/inst/doc/flowCut.html), and [FlowClean](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/flowClean/inst/doc/flowClean.pdf)) tackle distinguishing and removing bad quality events. We will see how they perform with previously identified good quality and horrific quality .fcs files. We will whether the implemented algorithmic decisions made sense, and how to customize them within our workflows to achieve our own desired goals.

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

### Building your First R package

![](images/R.png){width=33%}

[**Week 23:**]{.underline} For most of the course, we have been working with R packages that other individuals built and maintained. In this session, we leverage all your hard work from the rest of the course and corral the unwieldly arsenal of functions you wrote into your [first R package](https://r-pkgs.org/introduction.html) for easier use. We will discuss the individual pieces of an R package, the importance of a well-setup namespace file, and how to generate help page manuals to refer future-you back to what your individual function arguments actually do. 

<br>
<br>

### Reproducibility and Replicability

![](https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2F533452a/MediaObjects/41586_2016_BF533452a_Fige_HTML.jpg){width=50%}

[**Week 24:**]{.underline} Throughout the course, we emphasized the importance of making your workspaces and code reproducible and replicable. But what do we mean by these terms, and are there best practices we could add to our existing workflow to do this more efficiently? We explore a couple community-led efforts within the cytometry space and troubleshoot their implementation into a previously published pipeline. 

<br>
<br>

### Validating Algorthmic Tools

![](https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41f9FvgwgzL.jpg){width=50%}

[**Week 25:**]{.underline} We will be the first to admit, new implementations of algorithms as R packages are awesome! We appreciate the effort that went into them and making them available to the community at large. But what is the best way of evaluating whether they behave as promised, or work for our dataset? During this session, we share tips and tricks to gain better understanding of how a new R package works, and things to watch out for when evaluating complicated algortithms. We wrap with walkthrough of how to generate simulated datasets with known distributions for use in testing. 

<br>
<br>

### Everyone Get's a Quarto Website

![](images/3L_V1_Gain_2024.png){width=75%}

[**Week 26:**]{.underline} In this session, we will extend the knowledge of .R and .qmd files you have gained from the course and extend them to create your own website using [Quarto](). We discuss the additional files that are required, how to customize and render the website locally, and finally set up [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) website that we are to access online. 

<br>
<br>

### Open Source Licenses

![](https://cdn.media.amplience.net/i/epammarketplace/Software_Licenses_1?maxW=1200&qlt=80&fmt=jpg&bg=rgb(255,255,255)&v=1365581685114){width=50%}

[**Week 27:**]{.underline} For this course, we have relied extensively on open-source software to create our own data analysis pipelines. In the process, you may have some recollection of the various license names. But what impact do all these different names have in the end? We take a brief deep-dive into the ecosystem of [free and open-source licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and evaluate what their respective license terms mean for us as individual users of the code, as well as potential developers extending existing codebases. 

<br>
<br>

### Databases and Repositories

![](images/Database.png){width=50%}

[**Week 28:**]{.underline} During this session, we will learn how to identify and retrieve .fcs files from databases. While many of us are accustomed to working with large datasets of our own making, many of us are increasingly encountering larger-than-memory datasets, as well as files stored in large repositories. In this session, we will explore several database focused R [packages](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/), before investigating how to identify and retrieve .fcs files and associated metadata of interest from repositories, namely [ImmPort](https://www.immport.org/shared/) (and maybe [FlowRepository](https://flowrepository.org/) if it can be pinged that afternoon).

<br>
<br>

### Assembling Web Data

![](https://media.brightdata.com/2023/01/Web-scraping-with-R.png){width=50%}

[**Week 29:**]{.underline} In this session, we briefly delve into the concepts of web-scraping and APIs in general. We highlight useful packages, namely [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/) and [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), and best practices implemented to allow respectful retrieval of useful data without crashing someone's server like some AI startup bot. We finish by providing a list of additional useful resources for those interested in learning more. 

<br>
<br>

### Future Directions

![](images/Future.jpg){width=75%}

[**Week 30:**]{.underline} In this final of the planned sessions, we revisit our solutions to the challenge problems set out during the beginning of the course. We also discuss potential future topics to visit in the future, and any additional resources that proved helpful throughout the course.
